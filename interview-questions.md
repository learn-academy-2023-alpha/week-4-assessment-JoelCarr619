# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: objective - oriented programming is based on the concepts of objects, each with it's own properties or attributes. Functional programming mainly supports abstraction over data and abstraction over behavior. 

Researched answer: n object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes.Functional programming provides high performance in processing large data for applications. Object-oriented programming is not good for big data processing.

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integers are whole numbers, such as 10. However, floats are numbers that contain a decimal point, such as 10.5, 10.0, or 0.25.

Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when more precision is needed.

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Ruby's implicit return means that if a return is the last expression in a path of execution, there's no need for the return keyword
